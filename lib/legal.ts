    `Ambit's Privacy Policy describes how Ambit collects, uses, and shares your personal data. We built Ambit to help student builders find each other — and we've built it to respect your privacy along the way. This policy is written in plain language, and we mean every word of it.`,
  sections: [
    {
      heading: 'What Is Personal Data at Ambit?',
      body: `At Ambit, we believe strongly in your fundamental right to privacy. "Personal data" is data that identifies you or that can reasonably be linked to you — like your name, profile, messages, and email address. Data that we cannot connect back to you isn't personal data.`,
    },
    {
      heading: 'Your Privacy Rights at Ambit',
      body: `You control your presence on Ambit. You can view and edit your profile at any time, block or report other users, and permanently delete your account and all associated data from the profile screen. Depending on where you live, you may also have the right to access, correct, or export your personal data — just reach out and we'll help.

You never have to pay a fee or trade a benefit to exercise these rights.`,
    },
    {
      heading: 'Personal Data Ambit Collects from You',
      body: `You share some information with us directly when you set up your profile and use the app:

• **Account information.** Such as your university (.edu) email address and your name.
• **Profile details.** Such as your photo, bio, skills, campus, role (seeker or owner), and whether you're a student or professor.
• **Links you add.** Such as your GitHub, LinkedIn, personal site, and any résumé you upload, which we process to help fill in your profile.
• **Content you create.** Such as portfolio items and images, projects and cover images, and the messages and photos you send to other users.`,
    },
    {
      heading: 'Personal Data Ambit Collects Automatically',
      body: `Some information is collected as you use the app:

• **Activity and reliability signals.** Such as your response rate and last active time, used to power matching and show reply-tier badges.
• **A push-notification token.** So we can let you know when someone reaches out or replies.
• **Permission-based data.** Such as your calendar availability (read on your device to help schedule meetings) and camera or photo access (to add images) — only with your permission.
• **Advertising identifier.** Such as your device's advertising ID, used to show rewarded ads only if you allow tracking (see "Advertising and Tracking").`,
    },
    {
      heading: 'How Ambit Uses Your Personal Data',
      body: `We use your data to run the app and make it better: to create and secure your account, power matching and discovery, deliver your messages, send notifications you've asked for, help you schedule meetings, show rewarded ads you choose to watch, and keep the community safe by acting on reports and blocks. We also create a numerical representation of your profile text to improve how well matches fit.

We do not use your data to build advertising profiles about you, and we never sell your personal data.`,
    },
    {
      heading: 'How Ambit Shares Personal Data',
      body: `• **With other users.** Your profile and the content you choose to share are visible to other users — that's the core of how Ambit works.
• **With service providers.** Such as our cloud host and database (Supabase), push notifications (Expo), advertising (Google AdMob), and AI-assisted résumé parsing and matching. They may only process your data to provide their services to us.
• **For legal and safety reasons.** To comply with the law, enforce our Terms, or protect the rights, safety, and integrity of Ambit and its users.`,
    },
    {
      heading: 'Advertising and Tracking',
      body: `Ambit shows rewarded ads through Google AdMob when you choose to watch one to unlock an extra reach-out. On iOS, we ask for your permission through Apple's App Tracking Transparency prompt before any tracking. If you decline, we simply request non-personalized ads. You can change your choice anytime in your device Settings.`,
    },
    {
      heading: 'Protection of Personal Data at Ambit',
      body: `We use technical and organizational measures to protect your data, including encrypted storage of your login session on your device and access controls on our backend. No system is perfectly secure, but safeguarding your information is something we work at continuously.`,
    },
    {
      heading: 'Children and Personal Data',
      body: `Ambit is not directed to children. You must be at least 18 to use Ambit, and our university-email requirement is designed to keep the service limited to adult members of university communities. We do not knowingly collect personal data from anyone under 13.`,
    },
    {
      heading: 'Retaining and Deleting Your Data',
      body: `We keep your information for as long as your account is active. Whenever you're ready, you can permanently delete your account from the profile screen — this removes your profile, projects, portfolio, messages, matches, and uploaded files.`,
    },
    {
      heading: 'Our Commitment to Your Privacy',
      body: `Protecting your privacy isn't a feature we bolted on — it's part of how Ambit is built. We collect what we need to make the app work, we're clear about it, and we put you in control of your data.`,

    {
      heading: 'Privacy Questions',

      body: `Ambit is provided "as is," without warranties of any kind.
